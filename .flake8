# Ignored rules

# E203 - whitespace before ':' " on list slice
# PEP 8 recommends to treat : in slices as a binary operator with the lowest
# priority, and to leave an equal amount of space on either side, except if a
# parameter is omitted. Black enforces these rules consistently.

# E266
# Too many leading ‘#’ for block comment

# E501
# line too long > 80 characters
# We ignore this error from flake because black automatically enforces it
# most of the times. Only place where it doesn't enforce is with strings.
# For that we have B950 enabled.


# W503
# Black will break a line before a binary operator when splitting a block
# of code over multiple lines. This is so that Black is compliant with
# the recent changes in the PEP 8 style guide
